## Humans and Questions ##

![bg left](https://i.postimg.cc/vmB4FH9V/think.gif)

- Why so many stars?
- Where are we living?
- Are we so special?

---
## Legacy of Aristotle ##

- believed in a geocentric Universe
- thought movements of the planets and stars must be circular
- believed entire universe is made of five components
- planets and stars were perfect  spheres though Earth itself was not

## Ptolemy: The Predictor ##

- Earth was the center of the Universe
- combined stars' movements with geometry, to predict the movements of the planets
- to make his predictions true, he worked out that the planets must move in epicycles, smaller circles
- flawed view of the Universe was accepted for many centuries

## Nicolaus Copernicus ##

- his heliocentric system put the Sun (helio) at the center of our system
- used his  own observations of the movements of the planets to back up his idea
- his ideas were too different for most of the scholars of his time to accept
- those who did study his work intact often did so in secret and they were called Copernicans

## Galileo Galilei: An Amazing Genius ##

- his own ideas on how motion really worked opposed what Aristotle had taught
- devised a telescope that could enlarge objects up to 20 times
- his observations which went against the established teaching of the Church
- Other scientists, seized its importance and learned more about the world

## Kepler and his Three Laws ##

- every planet’s orbit is an ellipse with the Sun at a focus
- a line joining the Sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times
- **the square of a planet’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit**

## Ole Roemer and the Speed of Light ##

- Until that time, scientists assumed that the speed of light was either too fast to measure or infinite
- extensive observations of the orbit of Io, Jupyter's four big satellites paved a way to determine velocity of light

## James Clerk Maxwell ##

- Combined all the theories of electricity and magnetism and developed the theory of electromagnetism
- which showed that light was electromagnetic radiation
- paved the way for both quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of special relativity

## Special Theory of Relativity ##

- Einstein showed that simultaneity is relative; events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be for another
- counterintuitive idea that time flows differently according to the state of motion, and to the conclusion that distance is also relative
- The equation, E = mc$^2$ shows that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing
-  This equation also shows that mass increases with speed, which effectively puts a speed limit on how fast things can move in the universe

## Space Time ##

Space-time is a mathematical model that joins space and time into a single idea called a continuum. This four-dimensional continuum is known as Minkowski space. But in a relativistic universe, time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space.

## General Relativity ##

-  force of gravity with the changing geometry of space-time
-  the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present

## Particle Spin and Exclusion Principle ##

- an atom or molecule, no two electrons can have the same four electronic quantum numbers. As a
- an orbital can contain a maximum of only two electrons, the two electrons must have opposing spins

## Why do we exist? ##

- 13.8 billion years ago **The Big Bang**
- event produced equal amounts of the matter *(we are made of)* and something called antimatter
- every particle has an antimatter companion
- annihilate each other when they meet as burst of light
- **Why the universe we see today is made entirely out of matter is one of the greatest mysteries of modern physics.**

## CPT Symmetry ##

- All the physical laws should obey CPT symmetry
- But experiments show this isn’t always the case
- Mesons made up of quark & antiquark
- Antimeson can be produced by changing quark into an anti-quark and vice-versa
- But experiments have shown that this can happen more in one direction than the opposite one—creating more matter than antimatter over time.

## Black Holes ##

- A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong - No particles or even electromagnetic radiation can escape from it
- Black holes have three "layers": the outer and inner event horizon, and the singularity
- **Chandrasekar Limit**

---

## Legacy of Stephen Hawking ##
- General relativity, doesn’t take into account quantum mechanics. 
- Some unknown “theory of everything” was needed to unite the two.
- Hawking showed singularity at the universe’s origin signalled the need for quantum gravity

---

## Thermodynamic threat ##

-  second law of thermodynamics is one of the most well- established laws of nature
-  states that the entropy, or level of disorder in a system, always increases
-  **All matter contains entropy, so what happens when it is dropped into a black hole?**
-  If the total entropy of the universe goes down and black holes would violate the second law of thermodynamics

---
![bg right](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sD4RAyz2x4D8KjLVTqgMHP.jpg)
## Bekenstein and breakthrough ##

- A black hole hides its singularity with a boundary known as the event horizon
- Every time a black hole swallows matter, its entropy appears to be lost, and at the same time, its event horizon grows
- So, Bekenstein suggested, what if – to preserve the second law – the area of the horizon is itself a measure of entropy?

---

## Theory of everything ##

- The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy equation is the one Hawking asked to have engraved on his tombstone 
- It represents the ultimate mash-up of physical disciplines because 
  - it contains Newton’s constant, which clearly relates to gravity; 
  - Planck’s constant, which betrays quantum mechanics at play; 
  - the speed of light, the talisman of Einstein’s relativity; and 
  - the Boltzmann constant, the herald of thermodynamics.
- The presence of these diverse constants hinted at a theory of everything, in which all physics is unified.

## Black hole information loss paradox ##

**''Hawking radiation is black-body radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes, due to quantum effects near the black hole event horizon''**

- If black holes can radiate, they will eventually evaporate and disappear. So what happens to all the information that fell in? Does it vanish too?
- If so, it will violate a central tenet of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, if it escapes from the black hole, it will violate Einstein’s theory of relativity. 
- With the discovery of black hole radiation, Hawking had pit the ultimate laws of physics against one another.

## Hawking's paradox ##
When pairs of particles and antiparticles spawn near a black hole's event horizon, each pair shares a connection called entanglement. But what happens to this link and the information it holds when one of the pair falls in, leaving its twin to become a particle of Hawking radiation?

## String Theory ##

- The fundamental particles we observe are not point-like dots, but rather tiny strings that are so small that our best instruments cannot tell that they are not points.
- It predicts that there are extra dimensions to space beyond the obvious length, breadth and depth, but we do not experience them because they are bunched up in tiny spaces.

## Path to Quantum Gravity ##

- string theory is the path to quantum gravity
-  analogies will hold up at all scales
-  there will be an unambiguous, one-to-one mapping of the string picture onto the Universe we observe
-  if we make the judicious choices, we can get both General Relativity and the Standard Model out of it

## Anthropic principle ##

The anthropic principle is 
the philosophical premise that any data we collect about the universe is filtered by the fact that, in order for it to be observable at all, the universe must have been compatible with the emergence of conscious and sapient life that observes it.

## Is there a room for god? ##

- With the laws of physics, you can get universes
- Quantum mechanical fluctuations can produce the cosmos
- Just twist time and space the right way, you might create an entirely new universe. It's not clear you could get into that universe, but you would create it.
- The origin of the laws of physics remains a mystery for now, one that we may never be able to solve.
- As quoted by Physicist Filippenko, "The 'divine spark' was whatever produced the laws of physics, and I don't know what produced that divine spark. **So let's just leave it at the laws of physics.**"
